         * Problem statement: Consider a row of n coins of values v1 . . . vn, 
         * where n is even. We play a game against an opponent by alternating 
         * turns. In each turn, a player selects either the first or last coin 
         * from the row, removes it from the row permanently, and receives the 
         * value of the coin. Determine the maximum possible amount of money we
         * can definitely win if we move first.
         * 
         * Note: The opponent is as clever as the user.
         * 
         * Let us understand the problem with few examples:
         * 1. 5, 3, 7, 10 : The user collects maximum value as 15(10 + 5)
         * 
         * 2. 8, 15, 3, 7 : The user collects maximum value as 22(7 + 15)
         * 
         * Does choosing the best at each move give an optimal solution?
         * 
         * No. In the second example, this is how the game can finish:
         * 
         * 1.
         * a) User chooses 8.
         * b) Opponent chooses 15.
         * c) User chooses 7.
         * d) Opponent chooses 3.
         * Total value collected by user is 15(8 + 7)
         * 
         * 2.
         * a) User chooses 7.
         * b) Opponent chooses 8.
         * c) User chooses 15.
         * d) Opponent chooses 3.
         * Total value collected by user is 22(7 + 15)
         * 
         * So if the user follows the second game state, maximum value can be 
         * collected although the first move is not the best.
         * 
         * There are two choices:
         * 1. The user chooses the ith coin with value Vi: The opponent either 
         * chooses (i+1)th coin or jth coin. The opponent intends to choose the 
         * coin which leaves the user with minimum value.
         * i.e. The user can collect the value Vi + min(F(i+2, j), F(i+1, j-1) )
         * 
         *       |----Opponent---|
         * Vi    Vi+1 Vi+2......Vj-1 Vj
         *            |--Opponent----|
         * User
         * 
         * 
         * 2. The user chooses the jth coin with value Vj: The opponent either 
         * chooses ith coin or (j-1)th coin. The opponent intends to choose the 
         * coin which leaves the user with minimum value.
         * i.e. The user can collect the value Vj + min(F(i+1, j-1), F(i, j-2) )
         * 
         * |----Opponent--|
         * Vi Vi+1......Vj-2 Vj-1   Vj
         *    |---Opponent---|
         *                         User
         * 
         * Following is recursive solution that is based on above two choices. 
         * We take the maximum of two choices.
         * 
         * F(i, j)  represents the maximum value the user can collect from 
         * i'th coin to j'th coin.
         * F(i, j)  = Max(Vi + min( F(i + 2, j    ), F(i + 1, j - 1) ), 
         *                Vj + min( F(i + 1, j - 1), F(i,     j - 2) )) 
         * 
         * Base Cases
         * F(i, j)  = Vi           If j == i
         * F(i, j)  = max(Vi, Vj)  If j == i+1
         * 
         * Why Dynamic Programming?
         * The above relation exhibits overlapping sub-problems. In the above 
         * relation, F(i+1, j-1) is calculated twice.
