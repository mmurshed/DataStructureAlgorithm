     * Data Structure: Sliding Window Minimum / Monotonic Queue
     * Given an array of elements a0,a1,a2,…,an, and queries Q(i,i+L) which 
     * means "find the minimum element in ai,ai+1,…,ai+L". How can we answer 
     * such queries efficiently?
     * 
     * We can have an O(nlgn) complexity by using a minimum priority queue, 
     * RB tree, or a binary tree representation of multiset, but there in this 
     * setting we can implement a data structure called monotonic queue which 
     * only requires O(n) in construction. The implementation of this data 
     * structure requires a dequeue.
     * 
     * Let D be the dequeue which maintain a pair of information (i, ai). An 
     * important property of D that we will maintain is that element in D will 
     * always be in sorted order (invariant). We will first start with an empty 
     * D, and will insert ai and remove elements from D accordingly as we 
     * iterate from the left to the right of array a (which is from 
     * i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n).
     * 
     * Suppose that we are now at index i and considering to add ai. Notice that
     * when ai is added, all elements in (j, aj) in D such that aj is bigger 
     * than ai can never be a minimum value as we go forward, hence they can be
     * removed from D.
     * 
     * Furthermore, if the element (i-L-1, ai−L−1) is in D (which will be 
     * located at the top of D if it exists), we remove that element as well.
     * 
     * Lastly, we append ai at the back of D. Then we will have Q(i-L, i) = the
     * top element in D when we reach index i. Since each element will enter and
     * leave D only once, we have a total of O(N) operations.
