     * 
     * There are many problems in which you need to query on intervals or 
     * segments of a collection of items. For example, finding the sum of all 
     * the elements in an array from index left to right, or finding the minimum
     * of all the elements in an array from index left to right. These problems
     * can be easily solved with one of the most powerful data structures, 
     * Segment Tree ( in-short Segtree ).
     * 
     * What is Segment Tree ?
     * Segment tree or segtree is a basically a binary tree used for storing the
     * intervals or segments. Each node in the segment tree represents an interval.
     * 
     * Consider an array A of size N and a corresponding segtree T:
     * 1. The root of T will represent the whole array A[0:N-1].
     * 2. Each leaf in the segtree T will represent a single element A[i] such 
     *    that 0 <= i < N.
     * 3. The internal nodes in the segtree tree T represent union of elementary 
     *    intervals A[i:j] where 0 <= i < j < N.
     * 
     * The root of the segtree will represent the whole array A[0:N-1]. Then we 
     * will break the interval or segment into half and the two children of the 
     * root will represent the A[0:(N-1) / 2] and A[(N-1) / 2 + 1:(N-1)]. So in 
     * each step we will divide the interval into half and the two children will
     * represent the two halves. So the height of the segment tree will be log2N.
     * There are N leaves representing the N elements of the array. The number 
     * of internal nodes is N-1. So total number of nodes are 2*N - 1.
     * 
     * Once we have built a segtree we cannot change its structure i.e., its 
     * structure is static. We can update the values of nodes but we cannot 
     * change its structure. Segment tree is recursive in nature. Because of 
     * its recursive nature, Segment tree is very easy to implement. Segment 
     * tree provides two operations:
     * 
     * 1. Update: In this operation we can update an element in the Array and 
     *    reflect the corresponding change in the Segment tree.
     * 
     * 2. Query: In this operation we can query on an interval or segment and 
     *    return the answer to the problem on that particular interval.
     * 
     * Implementation:
     * Since a segtree is a binary tree, we can use a simple linear array to 
     * represent the segment tree. In almost any segtree problem we need think
     * about "what we need to store in the segment tree?".
     * 
     * For example, if we want to find the sum of all the elements in an array 
     * from index left to right, then at each node (except leaf nodes) we will
     * store the sum of its children nodes. If we want to find the minimum of 
     * all the elements in an array from index left to right, then at each node
     * (except leaf nodes) we will store the minimum of its children nodes.
     * 
     * Once we know what we need to store in the segment tree we can build the 
     * tree using recursion ( bottom-up approach ). We will start with the 
     * leaves and go up to the root and update the corresponding changes in
     * the nodes that are in the path from leaves to root. Leaves represent a
     * single element. In each step we will merge two children to form an 
     * internal node. Each internal node will represent a union of its 
     * children’s intervals. Merging may be different for different problems.
     * So, recursion will end up at root which will represent the whole array.
     * 
     * For update, we simply have to search the leaf that contains the element
     * to update. This can be done by going to either on the left child or the
     * right child depending on the interval which contains the element. Once 
     * we found the leaf, we will update it and again use the bottom-up approach
     * to update the corresponding change in the path from leaf to root.
     * 
     * To make a query on the segment tree we will be given a range from l to r.
     * We will recurse on the tree starting from the root and check if the 
     * interval represented by the node is completely in the range from l to r.
     * If the interval represented by a node is completely in the range from 
     * l to r, we will return that node’s value. The segtree of array A of 
     * size 7 will look like :
     * 
     *                 [0 : 6]
     *                /        \
     *              /            \
     *            /                \
     *          [0:3]               [4:6]
     *         /    \              /     \
     *      [0:1]   [2:3]       [4:5]   [6:6]
     *     /     |  |    \      |    \
     *[0:0]  [1:1]  [2:2] [3:3] [4:4] [5:5]
     * 
     * In a linear array
     * tree[1] = A[0:6]
     * tree[2] = A[0:3]
     * tree[3] = A[4:6]
     * tree[4] = A[0:1]
     * tree[5] = A[2:3]
     * tree[6] = A[4:5]
     * tree[7] = A[6:6]
     * tree[8] = A[0:0]
     * tree[9] = A[1:1]
     * tree[10] = A[2:2]
     * tree[11] = A[3:3]
     * tree[12] = A[4:4]
     * tree[13] = A[5:5]
     *
     * All this we will get clear by taking an example. You can given an array A
     * of size N and some queries. There are two types of queries:
     * 
     * 1. Update: add a value of an element to val in the array A at a particular position idx.
     * 
     * 2. Query: return the value of A[l] + A[l+1] + A[l+2] + ... + A[r-1] + A[r] such that 0 <= l <= r < N
     * 
     * Naive Algorithm:
     * This is the most basic approach. For query simple run a loop from l to r 
     * and calculate the sum of all the elements. So query will take O(N). 
     * A[idx] += val will update the value of the element.
     * Update will take O(1). This algorithm is good if the number of update 
     * operations are very large and very few query operations.
     * 
     * Another Naive Algorithm:
     * In this approach we will preprocess and store the cumulative sum of the 
     * elements of the array in an array sum. For each query simply return 
     * (sum[r] - sum[l-1]). Now query operation will take O(1). But to update, 
     * we need to run a loop and change the value of all the sum[i] such that 
     * l <= i <= r. So update operation will take O(N). This algorithm is good 
     * if the number of query operations are very large and very few update 
     * operations.
     * 
     * Using Segment Tree:
     * Let us see how to use segment tree and what we will store in the segment 
     * tree in this problem. As we know that each node of the segtree will 
     * represent an interval or segment. In this problem we need to find the 
     * sum of all the elements in the given range. So in each node we will store
     * the sum of all the elements of the interval represented by the node. How 
     * do we do that? We will build a segment tree using recursion (bottom-up 
     * approach) as explained above. Each leaf will have a single element. All 
     * the internal nodes will have the sum of both of its children.
