         * 
         * A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is 
         * the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is 
         * lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source 
         * and has to reach destination. The rat can move only in two 
         * directions: forward and down.
         * 
         * In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is dead end and 1 means the 
         * block can be used in the path from source to destination. Note that 
         * this is a simple version of the typical Maze problem. For example,
         * a more complex version can be that the rat can move in 4 directions
         * and a more complex version can be with limited number of moves.
         * 
         * Following is an example maze.
         * <IMAGE>
         * Gray blocks are dead ends (value = 0). 
         * 
         * Following is binary matrix representation of the above maze.
         * {1, 0, 0, 0}
         * {1, 1, 0, 1}
         * {0, 1, 0, 0}
         * {1, 1, 1, 1}
         * 
         * Following is maze with highlighted solution path.
         * <IMAGE>
         * 
         * Following is the solution matrix (output of program) for the above 
         * input matrx.
         * 
         * {1, 0, 0, 0}
         * {1, 1, 0, 0}
         * {0, 1, 0, 0}
         * {0, 1, 1, 1}
         * 
         * All enteries in solution path are marked as 1.
         * 
         * Naive Algorithm
         * The Naive Algorithm is to generate all paths from source to 
         * destination and one by one check if the generated path satisfies 
         * the constraints.
         * 
         * while there are untried paths
         * {
         *      generate the next path
         *      if this path has all blocks as 1
         *      {
         *          print this path;
         *      }
         * }
         * 
         * Backtracking Algorithm
         * 
         * If destination is reached
         *      print the solution matrix
         * Else
         *      a) Mark current cell in solution matrix as 1. 
         *      
         *      b) Move forward in horizontal direction and recursively check if this 
         *      move leads to a solution. 
         * 
         *      c) If the move chosen in the above step doesn't lead to a solution
         *      then move down and check if  this move leads to a solution. 
         * 
         *      d) If none of the above solutions work then unmark this cell as 0 
         *      (BACKTRACK) and return false.
