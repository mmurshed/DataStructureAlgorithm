        /*
         * The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the 
         * length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all 
         * elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. 
         * For example, the length of LIS for {10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80}
         * is 6 and LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.
         * 
         *  _________________________________________
         * |arr[] | 10 | 22 | 9 | 33 | 50 | 60 | 80 |
         * |LIS   | 1  | 2  |   | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |
         *  -----------------------------------------
         * 
         * 
         * Optimal Substructure:
         * Let arr[0..n-1] be the input array and L(i) be the length of the 
         * LIS ending at index i such that arr[i] is the last element of the LIS.
         * 
         * Then, L(i) can be recursively written as:
         * L(i) = 1 + LongestSubseq( L(j) ) where 0 < j < i and arr[j] < arr[i]; or
         * 
         * L(i) = 1, if no such j exists.
         * 
         * To find the LIS for a given array, we need to return max(L(i)) where 0 < i < n.
         * 
         * Thus, we see the LIS problem satisfies the optimal substructure 
         * property as the main problem can be solved using solutions 
         * to subproblems.

        //Dynamic Programming with Binary Search
        /*
         * In this approach, we scan the array from left to right. 
         * We also make use of a dp array initialized with all 0's. This dp 
         * array is meant to store the increasing subsequence formed by 
         * including the currently encountered element. While traversing 
         * the nums array, we keep on filling the dp array with the elements 
         * encountered so far. For the element corresponding to the j th index 
         * (nums[j]), we determine its correct position in the dp array
         * (say i th index) by making use of Binary Search (which can be used 
         * since the dp array is storing increasing subsequence) and also insert
         * it at the correct position. An important point to be noted is that 
         * for Binary Search, we consider only that portion of the dp array in 
         * which we have made the updations by inserting some elements at their 
         * correct positions(which remains always sorted).
         * 
         * Thus, only the elements upto the i th index in the dp array can 
         * determine the position of the current element in it. Since, the 
         * element enters its correct position(i) in an ascending order in the 
         * dp array, the subsequence formed so far in it is surely an increasing
         * subsequence. Whenever this position index i becomes equal to the 
         * length of the LIS formed so far(len), it means, we need to update 
         * the len as len = len+1.
         * 
         * Note: dp array does not result in longest increasing subsequence, but
         * length of dp array will give you length of LIS.
         * 
         * Consider the example:
         * input: [0, 8, 4, 12, 2]
         * dp: [0]
         * dp: [0, 8]
         * dp: [0, 4]
         * dp: [0, 4, 12]
         * dp: [0, 2, 12] which is not the longest increasing subsequence, but
         * length of dp array results in length of Longest Increasing Subsequence.
