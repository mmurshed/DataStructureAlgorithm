        /* Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack 
         * of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. 
         * 
         * In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] 
         * which represent values and weights associated with n items 
         * respectively.
         * 
         * Also given an integer W which represents knapsack 
         * capacity.
         * 
         * Find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum 
         * of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You 
         * cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or don’t pick 
         * it (0-1 property).
         * 
         * Example:
         * value = {60, 100, 120}
         * weight = {10, 20, 30}
         * W = 50
         * 
         * Weight = 20 + 10, Value = 100 +  60 = 160
         * Weight = 30 + 10, Value = 120 +  60 = 180
         * Weight = 30 + 20, Value = 120 + 100 = 220
         * Weight = 30 + 20 + 10 > 50
         * 
         * Solution: 220
         * 
         * A simple solution is to consider all subsets of items and calculate 
         * the total weight and value of all subsets. Consider the only subsets 
         * whose total weight is smaller than W. From all such subsets, 
         * pick the maximum value subset.
         * 
         * 1) Optimal Substructure:
         * To consider all subsets of items, there can be two cases for every 
         * item the item is,
         *      1. included in the optimal subset.
         *      2. NOT included in the optimal set.
         * 
         * Therefore, the maximum value that can be obtained from n items is 
         * max of following two values.
         * 1. Maximum value obtained by n-1 items and W weight (excluding nth item).
         * 2. Value of nth item plus maximum value obtained by n-1 items and 
         *  W minus weight of the nth item (including nth item).
         * 
         * If weight of nth item is greater than W, then the nth item cannot be
         * included and case 1 is the only possibility.
         * 
         * 2) Overlapping Subproblems
         * Following is recursive implementation that simply follows the 
         * recursive structure mentioned above.
         * 
         * It should be noted that the naive function computes the same 
         * subproblems again and again. See the following recursion tree, 
         * K(1, 1) is being evaluated twice. Time complexity of this naive 
         * recursive solution is exponential (2^n).
         * 
         * In the following recursion tree, K() refers to knapSack().  The two 
         * parameters indicated in the following recursion tree are n and W.  
         * The recursion tree is for following sample inputs.
         * wt[] = {1, 1, 1}, W = 2, val[] = {10, 20, 30}

                       K(3, 2)         ---------> K(n, W)
                   /            \ 
                 /                \               
            K(2,2)                  K(2,1)
          /       \                  /    \ 
        /           \              /        \
       K(1,2)      K(1,1)        K(1,1)     K(1,0)
       /  \         /   \          /   \
     /      \     /       \      /       \
K(0,2)  K(0,1)  K(0,1)  K(0,0)  K(0,1)   K(0,0)

         * Recursion tree for Knapsack capacity 2 units and 3 items of 1 unit weight.
         * 
         * Since suproblems are evaluated again, this problem has Overlapping 
         * Subprolems property. So the 0-1 Knapsack problem has both properties 
         * of a dynamic programming problem. Like other typical Dynamic 
         * Programming(DP) problems, recomputations of same subproblems can 
         * be avoided by constructing a temporary array K[][] in bottom up 
         * manner.
