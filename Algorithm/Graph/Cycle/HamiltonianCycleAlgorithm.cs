         * Hamiltonian Path in an undirected graph is a path that visits each 
         * vertex exactly once. A Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian circuit) is
         * a Hamiltonian Path such that there is an edge (in graph) from the 
         * last vertex to the first vertex of the Hamiltonian Path. Determine 
         * whether a given graph contains Hamiltonian Cycle or not. If it 
         * contains, then print the path. Following are the input and output 
         * of the required function.
         * 
         * Input:
         * A 2D array graph[V, V] where V is the number of vertices in graph and
         * graph[V, V] is adjacency matrix representation of the graph. A value 
         * graph[i, j] is 1 if there is a direct edge from i to j, otherwise 
         * graph[i, j] is 0.
         * 
         * Output:
         * An array path[V] that should contain the Hamiltonian Path. path[i] 
         * should represent the ith vertex in the Hamiltonian Path. The code 
         * should also return false if there is no Hamiltonian Cycle in the graph.
         * 
         * For example, a Hamiltonian Cycle in the following graph is 
         * {0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 0}. There are more Hamiltonian Cycles in the graph 
         * like {0, 3, 4, 2, 1, 0}
         * 
         * (0)--(1)--(2)

         * |  /   \  | 
         * | /     \ |
         * (3)-------(4)
         * 
         * And the following graph doesn’t contain any Hamiltonian Cycle.
         *

         * Naive Algorithm
         * Generate all possible configurations of vertices and print a 
         * configuration that satisfies the given constraints. There will be 
         * n! (n factorial) configurations.
         * 
         * while there are untried conflagrations
         * {
         *      generate the next configuration
         *      if ( there are edges between two consecutive vertices of this
         *      configuration and there is an edge from the last vertex to 
         *      the first ).
         * 
         *      {
         *          print this configuration;
         *          break;
         *      }
         * }
         * 
         * Backtracking Algorithm
         * Create an empty path array and add vertex 0 to it. Add other 
         * vertices, starting from the vertex 1. Before adding a vertex, 
         * check for whether it is adjacent to the previously added vertex and 
         * not already added. If we find such a vertex, we add the vertex as 
         * part of the solution. If we do not find a vertex then we return false.
