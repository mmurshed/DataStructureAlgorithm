Prim’s algorithm
Our first MST method, known as Prim’s algorithm, is to attach a new edge to a single growing tree at each step. Start with any vertex as a single-ver- tex tree; then add V􏰀1 edges to it, always taking next (coloring black) the minimum-
    
Proposition L. Prim’s algorithm computes the MST of any connected edge-weighted graph.
Proof: Immediate from Proposition K. The growing tree defines a cut with no black edges; the algorithm takes the crossing edge of minimal weight, so it is successively coloring edges black in accordance with the greedy algorithm.

  Prim’s MST algorithm
The one-sentence description of Prim’s algorithm just given
leaves unanswered a key question: How do we (efficiently) find the crossing edge of minimal weight? Several methods have been proposed—we will discuss some of them after we have developed a full solution based on a particularly
simple approach.
Data structures. We implement Prim’s algorithm with the aid of a few simple and familiar data structures. In particular, we represent the vertices on the tree, the edges on the tree, and the crossing edges, as follows:
■ Vertices on the tree : We use a vertex-indexed boolean array marked[], where marked[v] is true if v is on the tree.
■ Edges on the tree : We use one of two data structures: a queue mst to collect MST edges or a vertex-indexed array edgeTo[] of Edge objects, where edgeTo[v] is the Edge that connects v to the tree.
■ Crossing edges : We use a MinPQ<Edge> priority queue that compares edges by weight (see page 610).
These data structures allow us to directly answer the basic question “Which is the min- imal-weight crossing edge?”
Maintaining the set of crossing edges. Each time that we add an edge to the tree, we also add a vertex to the tree. To maintain the set of crossing edges, we need to add to the priority queue all edges from that vertex to any non-tree vertex (using marked[] to identify such edges). But we must do more: any edge connecting the vertex just added to a tree vertex that is already on the priority queue now becomes ineligible (it is no longer a crossing edge because it connects two tree vertices). An eager implementation
 
of Prim’s algorithm would remove such edges from the priority queue; we first consider a simpler lazy implementation of the algorithm where we leave such edges on the priority queue, deferring the eli- gibility test to when we remove them.
