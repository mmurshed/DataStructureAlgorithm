         * Backtracking is an algorithmic paradigm that tries different 
         * solutions until finds a solution that “works”. Problems which are 
         * typically solved using backtracking technique have following property
         * in common. These problems can only be solved by trying every possible
         * configuration and each configuration is tried only once. A Naive 
         * solution for these problems is to try all configurations and output
         * a configuration that follows given problem constraints. Backtracking
         * works in incremental way and is an optimization over the Naive 
         * solution where all possible configurations are generated and tried.
         * 
         * For example, consider the following Knight’s Tour problem.
         * The knight is placed on the first block of an empty board and, moving
         * according to the rules of chess, must visit each square exactly once.
         * 
         * Path followed by Knight to cover all the cells
         * 
         * Following is chessboard with 8 x 8 cells. Numbers in cells indicate
         * move number of Knight.

         * Let us first discuss the Naive algorithm for this problem and then 
         * the Backtracking algorithm.
         * 
         * Naive Algorithm for Knight’s tour
         * The Naive Algorithm is to generate all tours one by one and check if 
         * the generated tour satisfies the constraints.
         * 
         * while there are untried tours
         * { 
         *      generate the next tour 
         *      if this tour covers all squares 
         *      { 
         *          print this path;
         *      }
         * }
         * 
         * Backtracking works in an incremental way to attack problems. 
         * Typically, we start from an empty solution vector and one by one add 
         * items (Meaning of item varies from problem to problem. In context of
         * Knight’s tour problem, an item is a Knight’s move). When we add an 
         * item, we check if adding the current item violates the problem 
         * constraint, if it does then we remove the item and try other 
         * alternatives. If none of the alternatives work out then we go to 
         * previous stage and remove the item added in the previous stage. If 
         * we reach the initial stage back then we say that no solution exists.
         * If adding an item doesn’t violate constraints then we recursively add
         * items one by one. If the solution vector becomes complete then we 
         * print the solution.
         * 
         * Backtracking Algorithm for Knight’s tour
         * Following is the Backtracking algorithm for Knight’s tour problem.
         * 
         * If all squares are visited 
         *      print the solution
         * Else
         *      a) Add one of the next moves to solution vector and recursively 
         *      check if this move leads to a solution. (A Knight can make maximum 
         *      eight moves. We choose one of the 8 moves in this step).
         * 
         *      b) If the move chosen in the above step doesn't lead to a solution
         *      then remove this move from the solution vector and try other 
         *      alternative moves.
         * 
         *      c) If none of the alternatives work then return false (Returning false 
         *      will remove the previously added item in recursion and if false is 
         *      returned by the initial call of recursion then "no solution exists" )
         * 
         * Following are implementations for Knight’s tour problem. It prints 
         * one of the possible solutions in 2D matrix form. Basically, the 
         * output is a 2D 8*8 matrix with numbers from 0 to 63 and these numbers
         * show steps made by Knight.
