        /* Given a sequence, find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in it.
         * 
         * Input: GEEKSFORGEEKS
         * Output: 5
         * EEKEE, EESEE, EEFEE, ...
         * 
         * As another example, if the given sequence is “BBABCBCAB”, then the 
         * output should be 7 as “BABCBAB” is the longest palindromic subseuqnce
         * in it. “BBBBB” and “BBCBB” are also palindromic subsequences of the 
         * given sequence, but not the longest ones.
         * 
         * The naive solution for this problem is to generate all subsequences 
         * of the given sequence and find the longest palindromic subsequence. 
         * This solution is exponential in term of time complexity. Let us see 
         * how this problem possesses both important properties of a Dynamic 
         * Programming (DP) Problem and can efficiently solved using Dynamic 
         * Programming.
         * 
         * 1) Optimal Substructure: 
         * Let X[0..n-1] be the input sequence of length n and L(0, n-1) 
         * be the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of X[0..n-1].
         * 
         * If last and first characters of X are same, 
         * then L(0, n-1) = L(1, n-2) + 2.
         * Else L(0, n-1) = MAX (L(1, n-1), L(0, n-2)).
         * 
         * Following is a general recursive solution with all cases handled.
         * 1. Every single character is a palindrome of length 1
         *      L(i, i) = 1 for all indexes i in given sequence
         * 
         * 2. IF first and last characters are not same
         *      If (X[i] != X[j])  L(i, j) =  max{L(i + 1, j),L(i, j - 1)} 
         * 
         * 3. If there are only 2 characters and both are same
         *      Else if (j == i + 1) L(i, j) = 2  
         * 
         * 4. If there are more than two characters, and first and 
         * last characters are same
         * Else L(i, j) =  L(i + 1, j - 1) + 2 
         * 
         * 2) Overlapping Subproblems
         * Following is simple recursive implementation of the LPS problem. 
         * The implementation simply follows the recursive structure mentioned above.
         * 
         * For the naive implementation, following is a partial recursion tree 
         * for a sequence of length 6 with all different characters.
