         * Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply
         * these matrices together. The problem is not actually to perform the 
         * multiplications, but merely to decide in which order to perform the
         * multiplications.
         * 
         * We have many options to multiply a chain of matrices because matrix 
         * multiplication is associative. In other words, no matter how we 
         * parenthesize the product, the result will be the same. For example, 
         * if we had four matrices A, B, C, and D, we would have:
         *      (ABC)D = (AB)(CD) = A(BCD) = ....
         * 
         * However, the order in which we parenthesize the product affects the 
         * number of simple arithmetic operations needed to compute the product,
         * or the efficiency. For example, suppose A is a 10 × 30 matrix, B is a
         * 30 × 5 matrix, and C is a 5 × 60 matrix. Then,
         * 
         *      (AB)C = (10×30×5) + (10×5×60) = 1500 + 3000 = 4500 operations
         *      A(BC) = (30×5×60) + (10×30×60) = 9000 + 18000 = 27000 operations.
         * 
         * Clearly the first parenthesization requires less number of operations.
         * 
         * Given an array p[] which represents the chain of matrices such that 
         * the ith matrix Ai is of dimension p[i-1] x p[i]. We need to write a 
         * function MatrixChainOrder() that should return the minimum number of 
         * multiplications needed to multiply the chain.
         * 
         * Input: p[] = {40, 20, 30, 10, 30}   
         * Output: 26000  
         * 
         * There are 4 matrices of dimensions 40x20, 20x30, 30x10 and 10x30.
         * Let the input 4 matrices be A, B, C and D.  The minimum number of 
         * multiplications are obtained by putting parenthesis in following way
         * (A(BC))D --> 20*30*10 + 40*20*10 + 40*10*30
         * 
         * Input: p[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 30} 
         * Output: 30000 
         * 
         * There are 4 matrices of dimensions 10x20, 20x30, 30x40 and 40x30. 
         * Let the input 4 matrices be A, B, C and D.  The minimum number of 
         * multiplications are obtained by putting parenthesis in following way
         * ((AB)C)D --> 10*20*30 + 10*30*40 + 10*40*30
         * 
         * Input: p[] = {10, 20, 30}  
         * Output: 6000  
         * There are only two matrices of dimensions 10x20 and 20x30. So there 
         * is only one way to multiply the matrices, cost of which is 10*20*30
         * 
         * 1) Optimal Substructure:
         * A simple solution is to place parenthesis at all possible places, 
         * calculate the cost for each placement and return the minimum value. 
         * In a chain of matrices of size n, we can place the first set of 
         * parenthesis in n-1 ways. For example, if the given chain is of 4 
         * matrices. let the chain be ABCD, then there are 3 ways to place first
         * set of parenthesis outer side: (A)(BCD), (AB)(CD) and (ABC)(D). So 
         * when we place a set of parenthesis, we divide the problem into 
         * subproblems of smaller size. Therefore, the problem has optimal 
         * substructure property and can be easily solved using recursion.
         * 
         * Minimum number of multiplication needed to multiply a chain of size 
         * n = Minimum of all n-1 placements (these placements create 
         * subproblems of smaller size)
         * 
         * 2) Overlapping Subproblems
         * Following is a recursive implementation that simply follows the above
         * optimal substructure property.

         * matrix chain of size 4. The function MatrixChainOrder(p, 3, 4) is
