         * 
         * From a given position, when we try to see if 
         * we can jump to a GOOD position, we only ever use one - the first one 
         * (see the break statement). In other words, the left-most one. If we 
         * keep track of this left-most GOOD position as a separate variable, 
         * we can avoid searching for it in the array. Not only that, but we 
         * can stop using the array altogether.
         * 
         * Iterating right-to-left, for each position we check if there is a 
         * potential jump that reaches a GOOD index (currPosition + 
         * nums[currPosition] >= leftmostGoodIndex). If we can reach a 
         * GOOD index, then our position is itself GOOD. Also, this new GOOD 
         * position will be the new leftmost GOOD index. Iteration continues 
         * until the beginning of the array. If first position is a GOOD index
         * then we can reach the last index from the first position.
         * 
         * To illustrate this scenario, we will use the diagram below, for input
         * array nums = [9, 4, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0]. We write G for GOOD, B for BAD 
         * and U for UNKNOWN. Let's assume we have iterated all the way to 
         * position 0 and we need to decide if index 0 is GOOD. Since index 1 
         * was determined to be GOOD, it is enough to jump there and then be 
         * sure we can eventually reach index 6. It does not matter that 
         * nums[0] is big enough to jump all the way to the last index. 
         * All we need is one way.
         * 
         * Index    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
         * nums     9   4   2   1   0   2   0
