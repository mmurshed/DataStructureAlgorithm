        /* Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have 
         * infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins, 
         * how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesn’t matter.
         * 
         * For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: 
         * {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. So output should be 4. For N = 10 
         * and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2}, 
         * {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}. So the output should be 5.
         * 
         * 1. Optimal Substructure
         * To count total number solutions, we can divide all set solutions in two sets.
         * 1. Solutions that do not contain mth coin (or Sm).
         * 2. Solutions that contain at least one Sm.
         * 
         * Let count(S[], m, n) be the function to count the number of solutions,
         * then it can be written as sum of count(S[], m-1, n) and count(S[], m, n-Sm).
         * 
         * Therefore, the problem has optimal substructure property as the 
         * problem can be solved using solutions to subproblems.
         * 
         * 2. Overlapping Subproblems
         * Following is a simple recursive implementation of the Coin Change 
         * problem. The implementation simply follows the recursive structure 
         * mentioned above.
         * 
         * It should be noted that the above function computes the same 
         * subproblems again and again. See the following recursion tree for 
         * S = {1, 2, 3} and n = 5.
         * 
         * The function C({1}, 3) is called two times. If we draw the complete 
         * tree, then we can see that there are many subproblems being called 
         * more than once.

         * subproblems can be avoided by constructing a temporary array 
         * table[][] in bottom up manner.
